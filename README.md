# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
# Here it will be explained how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

The content of this repository is the following:
  1. "run_analysis.R": R-Script to merge and clean the dataset
  2. "CodeBook.Rmd": Codebook as Markdown File
  3. "README.md": This Readme File as an overview

The R-Script explains how the data is imported, merged, and cleaned to fit the requirements of the task. Furthermore, the final dataset, where the data is grouped by the individuals, is created within this script. For detailed information please see "run_analysis.R"
In the Codebook, the variables are shortly explained.
The README provides a quick overviev over the project.
The final dataset is obtained by running the R-script described above.
